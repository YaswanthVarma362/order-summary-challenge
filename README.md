## Overview

I recently started learning HTML and CSS, So I just took this newbie challenge to check whether I can apply those what I've learned. This is my first project so it was a bit difficult to do and got stuck in middle, after searching in docs for minutes, I finally managed to complete the challenge. But what I've done is not entirely same as the challenge, So I am looking for some feedback and advices to improve my skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I recently started learning HTML and CSS and this is a perfect challenge for my newbie skills. I did everything based on the things I learned and haven't learned any new thing. But hope to learn new things in future.

### Continued development

I found it difficult doing on my own, but figured it out by checking some docs. But still it is not correctly done, I hope I can learn and do it exactly as the challenge.

### Useful resources

- [This Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - helped me to check basic syntax and provided solutions when I'm stuck.
